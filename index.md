## Welcome to Bulls Barometer

Bulls Barometer was established in December 2020 to poll Chicago Bulls fans on their current feelings on the front office, coaching staff, and players. The results of these polls will be shared via data visualizations showing the movement of the fanbase's perception over time.

Additionally, Bulls Barometer will host occassional commentary on team's results and transactions.
